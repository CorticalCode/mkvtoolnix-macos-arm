# tools/check-upstream-tag-signing.sh
#
# Probes whether the upstream MKVToolNix codeberg repo signs its release tags
# with the pinned mbunkus key. Run before deploying git verify-tag in
# build-local.sh — if upstream doesn't sign tags, that block will fail closed
# on every build.
#
# Also useful periodically: if mbunkus rotates his signing key (caught by
# verify-mbunkus-key.yml), re-running this confirms the rotated key is still
# being used to sign tags before build-local.sh starts trusting it.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/check-upstream-tag-signing.sh
#
# Reads from the same directory the script lives in:
#   - mbunkus-pubkey.asc
#   - mbunkus-fingerprint.txt
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all checked tags are signed by the pinned key
#   1 — one or more tags unsigned, or signed by a different key
#   2 — script error (clone failed, missing trust artifacts, etc.)
