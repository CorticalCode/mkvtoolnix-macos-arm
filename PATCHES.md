# Build Patches — What, Why, and How

Living document tracking every modification made to build MKVToolNix on macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), the problems encountered, and how they were resolved.

## Build status

Current release: **v98.0-b2026.04.1** (Apple Silicon + Intel). The build process uses a proven cache architecture with per-architecture storage: dependencies are compiled once, verified, and promoted to a cache. Subsequent builds restore from cache and only rebuild mkvtoolnix. See the "Build script fixes" section below for details.

## Size progression

| Build | DMG | App on disk | Qt actual | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------------|-----------|-------|
| b001 (baseline) | 34.9 MB | 84.8 MB | 6.10.0 | verified |
| b002 (+ strip dylibs) | 34.0 MB | 78.9 MB | 6.10.0 | verified |
| b003 (+ Qt bump) | 34.0 MB | 78.9 MB | **6.10.0** | RETRACTED — claimed 6.10.2 |
| b004 (+ no PrintSupport) | 33.9 MB | 78.4 MB | **6.10.0** | RETRACTED — claimed 6.10.2 |
| b005 (duplicate dylibs) | 42.8 MB | 101.8 MB | 6.10.2 | duplicate Qt dylibs — retracted |
| b006 (clean baseline) | 33.9 MB | 78.6 MB | 6.10.2 | verified |
| b007 (build-cache, full) | 33.9 MB | 78.6 MB | 6.10.2 | verified, full build |
| b008 (build-cache, restore) | 33.9 MB | 78.5 MB | 6.10.2 | verified, smart restore |
| b009 (+ O2, dead_strip) | 31.9 MB | 72.0 MB | 6.10.2 | ARM, verified, optimization flags |
| Intel b001 | 39.0 MB | 86.6 MB | 6.10.2 | Intel, verified, pre-optimization |

## Active patches (6 build patches + 1 Qt source patch)

### 1. Qt6 cmake install (`patches/qt6-cmake-install.patch`)

**File patched:** `packaging/macos/build.sh` line 373

**Problem:** The upstream `build_qt` function compiles Qt6 using `cmake --build` but then tries to install with `make DESTDIR=TMPDIR install`. Qt6's build system is fully cmake-based -- the Makefile install target doesn't work correctly for Qt6's module layout.

**Root cause:** Qt transitioned from qmake to cmake as its build system. The upstream MKVToolNix build script was written when `make install` still worked. Qt6's cmake build generates install rules that are only accessible via `cmake --install`.

**Fix:** Replace the install command in `build_qt`:
```
- build_tarball command "make DESTDIR=TMPDIR install"
+ build_tarball command "cmake --install . --prefix TMPDIR${TARGET}"
```

**Note:** Only the Qt-specific line (line 373) is patched. The generic `build_package` function (line 150) has the same `make install` pattern but it works fine for other cmake packages (cmark, etc.) because they generate proper Makefile install targets.

**Source:** MKVToolNix forum thread -- multiple users reported this fix for Qt6 builds.

---

### 2. Specs updates (`patches/specs-updates.patch`)

**File patched:** `packaging/macos/specs.sh`

This patch combines two changes to the same file to avoid context conflicts when applied in sequence.

**2a. Dead zlib download URL**

**Problem:** Build fails at zlib step. `curl` downloads a 355-byte HTML error page. Checksum verification catches it.

**Root cause:** `https://zlib.net/zlib-1.3.1.tar.xz` returns 404. zlib removes old tarballs when new versions release.

**Fix:** Switch to GitHub releases mirror (same file, same checksum):
```
- https://zlib.net/zlib-1.3.1.tar.xz
+ https://github.com/madler/zlib/releases/download/v1.3.1/zlib-1.3.1.tar.xz
```

**Shelf life:** Unnecessary when upstream bumps zlib or fixes the URL.

**2b. Qt version bump to 6.10.2**

**Problem:** Qt 6.10.0 has a compilation bug on ARM (`__yield` without `arm_acle.h` include) and community-reported UI issues (progress bar, preferences truncation, pane resizing, macOS 26 rendering).

**Fix:** Bump Qt from 6.10.0 to 6.10.2 with updated download URL and SHA256 checksum. Note: Qt 6.10.2 does NOT include the `arm_acle.h` fix — the Qt source patch is still required (see section 5).

---

### 3. Remove unused PrintSupport (`patches/remove-printsupport.patch`)

**File patched:** `packaging/macos/build.sh` (two locations)

**Problem:** Qt PrintSupport module (453 KB) is compiled and bundled in the app, but MKVToolNix has zero print functionality -- no references to `QPrinter`, `QPrintDialog`, or `QPrintPreview` anywhere in the source.

**Root cause:** The upstream Qt configure line doesn't explicitly exclude PrintSupport. It disables cups but not the broader print module.

**Fix:**
1. Add `-no-feature-printsupport` to the Qt configure arguments
2. Remove `PrintSupport*.dylib` from the dylib copy in `build_dmg`

**Verification:** Traced all Qt class imports in `src/mkvtoolnix-gui/` -- confirmed zero PrintSupport usage. Verified the module is absent from the built app bundle.

**Size impact:** 453 KB uncompressed, 138 KB compressed in DMG.

---

### 4. Strip debug symbols from dylibs (`patches/strip-dylibs.patch`)

**File patched:** `packaging/macos/build.sh` after line 512

**Problem:** Upstream strips the five mkv binaries but not the Qt shared libraries or plugins. Debug symbols in bundled third-party libraries add ~6 MB with no value in a distribution build.

**Root cause:** The upstream build was designed for a developer who could debug against these libraries.

**Fix:** Add `strip -x` after `fix_library_paths.sh` runs, targeting all dylibs in the app bundle. The `-x` flag removes local symbols (debug info) while preserving global symbols needed for dynamic linking.

**Why after fix_library_paths.sh:** Library path rewriting modifies the dylib binaries. Stripping before path fixup could remove relocation info needed by `install_name_tool`.

**Size impact:** 6 MB uncompressed (84.8 -> 78.9 MB), 0.9 MB compressed in DMG.

---

### 6. cmark Release build type (`patches/cmark-release-build.patch`)

**File patched:** `packaging/macos/build.sh` (build_cmark function)

**Problem:** The `build_cmark` function calls cmake without `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`. CMake defaults to an empty build type with no optimization flags, so cmark compiles at `-O0`.

**Fix:** Add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` to the cmake arguments. This enables standard `-O2 -DNDEBUG` optimization.

---

### 7. Remove pkg-config from Qt build (`patches/qt-remove-pkg-config.patch`)

**File patched:** `packaging/macos/build.sh` (build_qt function args)

**Problem:** Same as the Homebrew library leak — Qt links against system libraries instead of bundled copies, causing DYLD crashes on clean machines.

**Root cause:** Qt 6 intentionally disables pkg-config on macOS and removes `/opt/homebrew` and `/usr/local` from cmake search paths. The upstream `build_qt` args `-force-pkg-config -pkg-config` override this safeguard, re-enabling Homebrew prefix discovery.

**Fix:** Remove both `-force-pkg-config` and `-pkg-config` entirely. This restores Qt's macOS default behavior where Homebrew prefixes are stripped from cmake's search paths. Qt finds locally-built deps (zlib, etc.) via `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` / `--prefix` instead of pkg-config.

**Approach note:** This is the more principled fix (Approach B). It prevents the entire class of Homebrew leaks rather than forcing bundled copies of specific libraries. Being tested alongside Approach A (`qt-force-bundled-libs.patch`) which is more conservative.

**Source:** ChatGPT analysis of Qt 6's `QtBuildRepoHelpers.cmake` — confirmed Qt deliberately strips package-manager prefixes on Darwin when pkg-config is disabled.

---

## Config overlay (`config/config.local.sh`)

**Not a patch** -- a config file sourced by the upstream build system.

- `SIGNATURE_IDENTITY="-"` -- ad-hoc code signing (required for macOS Sequoia 15.1+; no Apple Developer cert needed)
- `DRAKETHREADS=12` -- parallel build threads (default is 4, machine has 14 cores)
- `CFLAGS += -O2` -- standard release optimization (upstream sets no -O flag)
- `CXXFLAGS += -O2` -- same for C++
- `LDFLAGS += -Wl,-dead_strip` -- remove unreachable code at link time

**Size impact of optimization flags:** 78.5 -> 72.0 MB uncompressed (8% reduction), 33.9 -> 31.9 MB DMG (6% reduction).

---

## Build script fixes (in `build-local.sh`)

**Proven cache architecture:** Compiled dependency packages are stored in an architecture-specific proven cache (`~/opt/proven/arm/` or `~/opt/proven/intel/`). Each build wipes the workspace (everything under `~/opt/` except `proven/` and `source/`), restores from the proven cache for the current architecture, and only builds what's missing. If all deps are available, only mkvtoolnix is rebuilt (minutes instead of hours). A full rebuild from source is available with `--full`.

**Promotion workflow:** After a successful build and manual testing, `--promote` archives the current proven cache to Git LFS, atomically swaps in the new packages, and commits. Uses directory-swap for atomicity — interruption at any point leaves either old or new proven intact.

**Post-build verification:** Checks Qt version in binary, architecture of all binaries and dylibs, duplicate dylib scan, size sanity (60-95 MB range), Homebrew/external library leak detection, and bundle inventory. Promotion is blocked if verification fails.

**Pre-build verification:** QTVER/specs.sh consistency check (already existed), stale build directory cleanup for all 14 dependencies (extended from Qt-only).

**EXPECTED_PACKAGES derived from specs.sh:** Package names are extracted dynamically from upstream's `spec_*` variables after sourcing specs.sh. Fails fast if any spec variable is missing (catches upstream renames). Eliminates version drift between specs.sh and the build script.

**cmark package rename:** Upstream names the cmark package `mtx-build.tar.gz`. Renamed to versioned `cmark-{version}.tar.gz` after build so version bumps invalidate the cache.

**DocBook XSL in cache:** Archived and restored alongside compiled packages.

**Error handling:** ERR trap prints line number and exit code on any command failure. Build output tee'd to timestamped log file. Build report with summary written after each build. Patch application distinguishes "already applied" from "genuinely broken."

**`command cp` / `/usr/bin/find`:** macOS zsh aliases `cp` to `cp -i` and may alias `find` to GNU find. `command cp` and `/usr/bin/find` bypass aliases.

**`git checkout -- .` before patching:** Ensures clean slate on re-runs.

## Qt source patches (`patches/qt-patches/`)

### 5. ARM `__yield` declaration (`qt-patches/001-fix-arm-yield-declaration.patch`)

**File patched:** `qtbase/src/corelib/thread/qyieldcpu.h` (applied to Qt source during extraction)

**Problem:** Qt6's `qyieldcpu.h` calls `__yield()` on ARM via `__has_builtin(__yield)`, but clang requires `<arm_acle.h>` to be included for the declaration. Without it, clang produces `-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration`.

**Fix:** Add `#include <arm_acle.h>` guarded by `Q_PROCESSOR_ARM` and `__has_include`.

**History:** This patch was incorrectly retired on 2026-04-13 based on reports that Qt 6.10.2 included the fix upstream. Inspection of the actual Qt 6.10.2 source confirmed the fix is NOT present. The retirement went undetected because the proven cache contained pre-compiled Qt that was built WITH the patch — a smart-restore build never recompiled Qt, masking the issue. A `--full` rebuild on 2026-04-14 exposed the missing fix. The patch was restored.

**Lesson:** Never retire a patch based on release notes alone. Always verify the fix in the actual upstream source, and always test with `--full` (not smart-restore) to confirm.

## Retired patches

(None currently.)

---

## Issues investigated but not requiring patches

**`-no-rpath` crash:** Flagged in research as a common Qt6 build failure. Not present in v98.0 -- already removed upstream.

**Dependency build failures on ARM:** No ARM-specific issues. All 15 dependencies build cleanly on Apple Silicon.

**macOS 13 deployment target:** No issues. Binaries built on macOS 26 with `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13` work correctly.

**Stale dependency URLs:** Checked all 17 URLs. Only zlib was dead (patched above). All others return 200.

---

## Issues discovered during development

### QTVER mismatch (discovered 2026-04-13)

**Severity:** High — caused mislabeled releases (r2, r3 removed)

**Problem:** specs-updates.patch changed specs.sh to download Qt 6.10.2, but QTVER in upstream config.sh remained 6.10.0. The build_qt function uses QTVER for the directory name after extraction. On ARM, a stale qt-everywhere-src-6.10.0 directory masked the error — builds appeared to succeed but used old Qt source. On Intel (clean machine), the directory didn't exist and the build correctly failed.

**Root cause:** Qt version is specified in multiple locations (specs.sh, config.sh, build-local.sh EXPECTED_PACKAGES) with no validation that they agree.

**Fix applied:**
- Set QTVER=6.10.2 in config.local.sh
- EXPECTED_PACKAGES derived dynamically from specs.sh
- Added pre-build check: verifies QTVER matches specs.sh, fails fast on mismatch
- Added stale Qt directory cleanup before extraction
- Added post-build check: confirms Qt version in the built binary

**Lesson:** Stale build artifacts can silently produce incorrect builds. Version changes must be validated end-to-end, not just at the download step. The build cache architecture now wipes the workspace before every build, preventing this class of error.
