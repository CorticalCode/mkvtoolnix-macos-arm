# Third-Party Notices — Proven Dependency Cache

The `proven/arm/` and `proven/intel/` directories contain pre-compiled binary
tarballs of the upstream dependencies needed to build MKVToolNix for macOS.
These tarballs are redistributed here as a build-time optimization so that
clean builds don't have to recompile identical dependencies on every run.

Both architectures (Apple Silicon `arm64` and Intel `x86_64`) contain the same
software built for their respective target; the licenses and obligations below
apply equally to both caches.

This notice acknowledges each project's authorship, license, and upstream
source. Full license texts are not reproduced here; they are preserved verbatim
inside each upstream source tarball (cached in `~/opt/source/` during builds,
or available at each project's homepage).

## MKVToolNix (the primary project)

The software whose distribution this repository supports. **All credit for
MKVToolNix itself belongs to Moritz Bunkus and the MKVToolNix contributors.**
This repository only provides macOS build automation — it contains no
MKVToolNix source code.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Project** | MKVToolNix |
| **Version** | 98.0 (build target; `proven/` does not bundle MKVToolNix binaries) |

## Runtime libraries bundled into the MKVToolNix application

These libraries are compiled from the sources below and end up inside the
shipped `.app` bundle. Both architecture caches contain equivalent builds.

## Build-time tools (used during build; not shipped in the `.app`)

Tarballs for these tools are included in `proven/` because they are built from
source as part of the dependency chain. Their binaries run on the build
machine and are not redistributed inside the final DMG — **they appear in
`proven/` only as compiled build-tool artifacts reused across builds.**

| **GNU autoconf** | 2.69 | `GPL-3.0-or-later` with autoconf exception | https://gnu.org/software/autoconf/ |
| **GNU automake** | 1.16.1 | `GPL-2.0-or-later` | https://gnu.org/software/automake/ |

## Source code availability (GPL / LGPL obligation)

For the GPL- and LGPL-licensed components listed above, source code is
available in three ways:

1. **Upstream projects** — follow the "Source" URL in each table above.
2. **Source tarballs cached locally during builds** at `~/opt/source/`
   (see `build-local.sh` for the download URLs in `specs.sh`).
3. **On request** — open an issue at
   https://github.com/CorticalCode/mkvtoolnix-gui-macos/issues and we will
   provide the exact source tarball used to produce any given release.

All source URLs are pinned by SHA256 checksums in upstream MKVToolNix's
`packaging/macos/specs.sh`; the same checksums are archived in this repo's
build output.
